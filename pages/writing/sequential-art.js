    <p>
      Comics, both web and traditional, have been a fascination of mine for some
      time. I wasn't brave enough to try my hand at creating them until I made a
      discovery during{" "}
      <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40mknepprath%20%23inktober">
        #inktober
      </a>{" "}
      2017 - the best way to get over drawing timidity is to use bold drawing
      tools. I started with pencil, transitioned to pen, and eventually cracked
      open my son's marker set. My resulting illustrations were as brazen as the
      drawing tools I was choosing to use.

    />
    <p>
      Last year, I decided to use this technique to draw some panels. It was
      rough, but I had to start somewhere.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Make comics. Who has time for that!"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-03.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      I posted my first comic as a reply to{" "}
      <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesInks/status/1021770737877692422">
        @JamesInks
      </a>
      , a talented comic artist, as a gag. I believe I was planning on replying
      to a bunch of tweets with comics, but I only ended up posting two this
      way.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="I love pie!!!"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-04.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      The second was in reply to{" "}
      <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesInks/status/1023671020560035842">
        a tweet about pie
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Sequential art"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-05.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      After this, I started{" "}
      <a href="https://twitter.com/mknepprath/status/1024083111091597312">
        a thread
      </a>{" "}
      that now includes 19 short comics. This first one,{" "}
      <strong>Sequential Art™</strong> was meant to be a light-hearted jab at
      the self-seriousness of some comic artists.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Sequential stress"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-06.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      I tried my hand at social commentary for my 4th comic,{" "}
      <strong>Sequential Stress™</strong>. These panels ended up being featured
      in Owen Williams' (<a href="http://twitter.com/ow">@ow</a>) article
      entitled, "
      <a href="https://char.gd/blog/2019/mobile-notifications-are-broken-its-time-to-fix-them">
        Notifications are broken. It's time to fix them.
      </a>
      "
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Demon bug!!"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-07.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      At this point, I was attempting to create at least one comic per day, so
      the subject matter turned trivial things I was dealing with. Like bugs.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Apple Watch activity rings"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-08.jpeg"
    />
    <p>And exercise.</p>
    <img
      alt="I will say nothing"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-09.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      There was a third panel here that turned out so bad, I cut it off. I
      enjoyed this two-panel reaction shot to post it despite that.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Flat La Croix"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-10.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      Most of my comics don't warrant a title. Perhaps this one didn't, either,
      but I decided to include it for some additional context.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Silly faces"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-11.jpeg"
    />
    <p>My son and I take pictures of our silly faces sometimes.</p>
    <img alt="Hair study" className="blog-image" src="/static/comics-12.jpeg" />
    <p>
      My hairstyle was in transition during this time. I did a few quick studies
      to nail how I wanted to portray it on the page.
    </p>
    <img alt="Duck" className="blog-image" src="/static/comics-13.jpeg" />
    <p>
      While simple, this is the first one where I played with the perspective.
      Perhaps a sequel is warranted, "honk."
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Butterflies"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-14.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      The goal of this study was to illustrate butterflies at various levels of
      resolution in interesting ways. Note that they become hearts as they fade
      into the distance.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Hair problems"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-15.jpeg"
    />
    <p>Again, hair transition issues.</p>
    <img
      alt="Disappearing can"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-16.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      Here, I attempted to portray a simple thing in comic form that couldn't
      happen in real life.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Robot vacuum"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-17.jpeg"
    />
    <p>Using line thickness and texture, I created a biopic of our RoboVac.</p>
    <img alt="RAAWRRRRR" className="blog-image" src="/static/comics-18.jpeg" />
    <p>
      After a brief hiatus, I came back to comics with a fresh perspective on my
      previous panels. I had become to careful, and it was time to loosen up a
      bit. This cat comic could be see more feral version of the original "MAKE
      COMICS" strip.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Candy witch"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-19.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      These few comics were illustrated around Halloween 2018. I drew the candy
      witch, a witch who trades a toy for candy.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Angsty pumpkin"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-20.jpeg"
    />
    <p>I also found the idea of an angsty pumpkin hilarious.</p>
    <img
      alt="Contemplative fisherman"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-21.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      This started out as a hand study, but resulted in one of my favorite
      strips - more realistic with multiple perspectives. There is a nostalgia
      to it, as well. I haven't gone fishing in years, if not decades.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Dragon costume"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-22.jpeg"
    />
    <p>
      Back to the Halloween theme, I thought it would be fun to illustrate a
      dragon - with a twist. It was my son's costume all along.
    </p>
    <img
      alt="Coffee high"
      className="blog-image"
      src="/static/comics-23.jpeg"
    />
    <p>Finally, a reaction shot to disappearing a mug of coffee.</p>
    <p>I had a lot of fun with these, and I hope to do more.</p>
