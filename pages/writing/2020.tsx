        Hello and welcome to my second annual year-in-review post, the first
        being last year&apos;s <Link href="/writing/2019">2019 in Review</Link>.
        Unlike 2019, I had actual goals this year - so I can give a report on
        how I did. Yay!

        I had big dreams for Lilt that weren&apos;t realized this year.
        Regardless, I did add a few new areas to the game and announced it on

          100 Days of SwiftUI

        by Paul Hudson. I learned A LOT this year, yet I didn&apos;t complete a
        single course. This was the only 2020 goal I failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;d be easy for me to say, well, this was an unrealistic goal. It
        doesn&apos;t reflect how I actually learn. So it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;d be easy. And while I do believe it&apos;s true, I don&apos;t
        want to jump ahead without pointing out the fact that I clearly
        didn&apos;t understand something about myself at the time of goal
        setting and will take this into consideration when setting goals for
        2021.
      </p>
      <h3>Draw, illustrate, animate! ‚úÖ</h3>
      <p>
        I managed to create a number of drawings and animations during the first
        half of this year as outlined in{" "}

          my mid-year review

        , more drawings, and started working on some 2D animations.

      <p>
        A few of my drawings were enhanced by a collection Copic markers I
        recently purchased, including the illustration for my most recent blog
        post, <Link href="/writing/ebooks">‚ÄúIt&apos;s Just the Algorithm‚Äù</Link>
        .
      </p>
      <h3>Bonus: Develop an iOS app ‚úÖ</h3>
      <p>
        One of my 2019 goals was to build an app. I spent quite a bit of time on
        this, but ended up failing to accomplish this goal. In hindsight, I feel
        that the main reason was my lack of Swift experience and the rush to
        build something before picking up even the basics of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn&apos;t set a repeat goal for this in 2020, and yet...{" "}

          <em>published</em> it
        </a>
        ! This was all thanks to the excellent 100 Days of SwiftUI course
        mentioned above. I didn&apos;t complete the course, yet I was able to do
        more with the knowledge I gained from it than I would&apos;ve ever
        imagined at the beginning of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to give some credit to Apple, as well. SwiftUI wasn&apos;t around
        for my previous attempts at iOS development, and it was a joy to work
        with.

      <h2>Cool Things</h2>
      <h3>Side projects</h3>
      <p>
        I worked on a lot of web-based side projects outside of my goals
        outlined at the beginning of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this year, I dropped all of my other projects to work on the{" "}
        <a

          rel="noopener noreferrer"

        >
          Culturally Irrelevant Recommendation Board
        </a>
        , a website inspired by a retired podcast of the same name. I spent a
        full month on this site and detailed out the process in a post entitled{" "}
        <Link href="/writing/culturally-irrelevant">
          Building a Culturally Irrelevant Recommendation Board
        </Link>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        I also worked on a game. I gave it a name,{" "}
        <a
          href="http://tinymystery.club"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Tiny Mystery Club
        </a>
        , and added some actual gameplay elements. I think it will be an
        interesting sandbox to play in next year.
      </p>
      <Image

        priority
        width={600}
      />
      <p>
        Finally, I did a bunch of work on my personal site. I integrated
        Goodreads and Letterboxd into my <Link href="/about">About</Link> page
        to display six of my most recently read books and watched movies.

      <h2>2021 Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s my list of what I&apos;d like to accomplish during the next
        year.
      </p>
      <h3>Read 15 books</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve been averaging less than 10 books per year. If I can make it
        to 10, I&apos;ll be happy.
      </p>
      <h3>Write 10 blog posts</h3>
      <p>
        I reached this goal, but I think 10 posts a year is a pretty good
        cadence and I&apos;d like to continue with it. Goals don&apos;t
        necessarily have to increase, my main hope is that they drive me to work
        on these things consistently.
      </p>
      <h3>Release the next chapter of Lilt</h3>
      <p>
        I have a couple goals for{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/familiarlilt">Lilt</a>. First, I hope to
        develop a user interface to help manage moves, locations, and items in
        the game (likely with React). Second, I want to introduce more areas to
        explore. While the interface would be nice for me, it doesn&apos;t add
        anything of interest for Lilt&apos;s players. This is why I want to
        focus on expanding the game first.
      </p>
      <h3>Complete 3 online courses - AXE</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve purchased a bunch of online courses over the years that
        I&apos;d like to finish. I hope to finish at least three of these during
        2020:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.3dfordesigners.com/">3D for Designers</a> by
          Devon Ko
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://testingjavascript.com/">Testing JavaScript</a> with
          Kent C. Dodds
        </li>
        <li>5 courses on Udemy (Swift, React, Python, TensorFlow...)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Complete a suite of 2D animations</h3>
      <p>
        I want to draw some more comics, create some short animations, etc. I
        don&apos;t care all that much about the format as long as I do some cool
        visual work. I may even dabble in capital &lquo;A&rquo; Art again.
