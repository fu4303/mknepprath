        <a href="http://www.mknepprath.com/ifttt/">IFTTT</a> introduced a new
        channel today: iOS Location. Yep, this means you can make your other
        channels interact with where you are located at any time. Want your
        lights to automatically turn on when you get home? Track when you arrive
        or leave from work? Send your spouse a text when youâ€™re heading home?
        IFTTT can automate all of that. Pretty cool, huh?
