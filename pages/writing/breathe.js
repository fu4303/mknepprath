          <p>
            In programming, there can be an obsession with brevity, compactness
            and cleverness (i.e. magic). How much can I do in one line? How few
            lines can I have in my component? How much can I abbreviate my
            variable names? All of this leads to the code equivalent of
            hyperventilation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if we let our code breathe a little? "Breathing room" here is
            defined as extra lines and empty space within code. Here are a
            couple ways this can be accomplished.
          </p>

          <h2>Use Blank Lines To Create Sections</h2>
          <p>
            A List Apart had a great article about the use of whitespace in web
            design entitled simply,{" "}
            <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/whitespace/">Whitespace</a>.
            This piece refers to a concept called{" "}
            <strong>active whitespace</strong>, "whitespace added to a
            composition to better emphasize or structure, information." In code,
            use whitespace (blank lines) to clearly separate imports, methods,
            and so on. Here's an example from this website:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-javascript">
              {`
  // External
  import parse from "date-fns/parse";
  import Link from "next/link";
  import { withRouter } from "next/router";

  // Components
  import Page from "core/page";

  // Data
  import { posts } from "../posts.json";

  class Writing extends React.Component {
    ...
              `}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            And, of course, there are examples of great whitespace usage in the
            official React docs. See the code samples in the{" "}
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class">
              Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
            </a>{" "}
            section. From the A List Apart article, " [W]hitespace creates
            breathing room and balance. Itâ€™s important."
          </p>

          <h2>Lint Rules</h2>
          <p>
            If a lint rule exists that enforces adding more lines and space,
            implement it. One example:{" "}
            <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/blob/master/docs/rules/html-closing-bracket-newline.md">
              vue/html-closing-bracket-newline
            </a>
            .{" "}
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-markup">
              {`
 <!-- Example A: -->
 <p
   id="foo"
   class="bar">
   baz
 </p>

 <!-- Example B: -->
 <p
   id="foo"
   class="bar"
 >
   baz
 </p>
              `}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Given the two options above, <strong>Example B</strong> allows for
            more breathing room. It's easier to understand at a glance. Multiply{" "}
            <strong>Example A</strong> by a dozen elements with varying numbers
            of attributes and it becomes increasingly difficult to see where
            attributes end and text/nested elements begin. I propose that when
            choosing between two lint rule options, always choose the one that
            adds more lines and space.
          </p>

          <h2>Close Blocks Clearly</h2>
          <p>
            While I do enjoy the simplicity of{" "}
            <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">Pug</a>, the
            template engine formerly known as Jade, I do believe some human
            processing speed is lost due to the lack of closing tags.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code className="language-markup">
              {`
<!-- Example A (Pug) -->
.fancy-link
	a(href="/")
    | Home
.fancy-link
  a(href="/about")
    | About

<!-- Example B -->
<div class="fancy-link">
	<a href="/">
		Home
	</a>
</div>
<div class="fancy-link">
	<a href="/about">
		About
	</a>
</div>
              `}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            While I love the brevity of Pug here, I personally think there's too
            much left to the imagination. Again, multiply{" "}
            <strong>Example A</strong> by a dozen different, nested elements and
            it becomes dense and difficult to parse.
          </p>

          <h2>Breathe!</h2>
          <p>
            On a fun website called{" "}
            <a href="https://www.dwitter.net">Dwitter</a>, contributors are
            challenged to see what they can create with 140 characters (or less)
            of JavaScript. While limiting characters can be a fun constraint,
            this isn't code I want to read on a day-to-day basis. Instead, let's
            luxuriate in the fact that we have room to breathe.{" "}
