      Facebook’s been releasing a lot of small updates to their platform,
      including hashtags and the ability to upload photos with your comments.
      Here’s one that snuck under my radar: embeddable Facebook posts. Twitter
      has had a similar feature for quite some time, and I know it has seen its
      fair share of use on blogs and news sites, so I’m not surprised to see
      this.
